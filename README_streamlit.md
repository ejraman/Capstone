# Streamlit Dashboard — SG Job Market

This Streamlit app summarizes and visualizes `SGJobData (2).csv` (large file ~273MB) by streaming the CSV in chunks and creating sampled datasets for interactive charts.

## Quick start
1. Create a Python environment (recommended: conda) and install requirements:

   conda create -n jobdash python=3.10 -y
   conda activate jobdash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app from the `capstone/` folder:

   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

3. Open the displayed URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) and use the sidebar to configure sample size, time aggregation, and percentile clipping.

## Notes
- The loader is designed to stream the data to avoid excessive memory use. It produces a sample for interactive visualizations.
- If you want faster iteration during development, create a small subsampled CSV and point the app at it via the sidebar.

## Screenshots 📸
Here are example snapshots generated from a representative sample of the dataset. These are saved under the `screenshots/` folder; you can regenerate them using `scripts/generate_screenshots.py`.
